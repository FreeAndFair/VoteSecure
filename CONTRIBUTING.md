# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository; when contributing changes to artifacts, please discuss the changes via GitHub issue, email to the project maintainers, or other method of communication before doing so. Note that this project has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which you should follow in all your interactions with the repository and the project team.

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you find a bug in the code or a mistake in our documentation or other artifacts, or you'd like to see a new feature, you can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues). Before you create an issue, please search the issue archive; it's possible that your issue has already been addressed, or is in the process of being addressed.

If the issue you've found has to do with security, please **do not file a public GitHub issue**. See [our documentation on reporting security issues](./SECURITY.md) for details.

If you file a GitHub issue, please try to make it:

- *Reproducible*. Include steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable).
- *Specific*. Include as much detail as possible; what version/repository revision, what environment are you running in, etc.
- *Unique*. Do not duplicate existing GitHub issues.
- *Scoped to a Single Problem*. One problem or feature request per GitHub issue.

If you have a concrete suggestion for addressing an issue (e.g., you've already written a patch), you can submit a pull request.

### How to Submit a Pull Request

2. Create a fork of the project.
3. Create a feature branch for your pull request (`git checkout -b feat/my_new_feature`).
4. Commit your changes to that branch. This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard, so you should do the same in your commit messages.
5. Push your changes to that branch.
6. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/compare?expand=1)
