# Tamarin Model for VoteSecure

This directory contains [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.com/) models for the VoteSecure protocol, as described in [the cryptographic protocol documentation](../../../docs/protocol). The models use Tamarin's rule-based syntax, rather than its pi-calculus syntax, primarily for better understandability when working with them interactively in Tamarin's user interface. Each subprotocol has its own model written in a way that supports basic _modularity_: each can be reasoned about independently, as well as when combined with approriate other subprotocols. This is accomplished with a combination of `m4` macros and Tamarin include directives, which the accompanying [Makefile](./Makefile) handles automatically for its various targets (these can be listed with `make help`).

In the current iteration of the VoteSecure project, our statement of work includes performing formal protocol _specification_ but not formal protocol _verification_. Nonetheless, we demonstrate via executability lemmas that each role within each of the subprotocols is executable, both in isolation and when combined with the other subprotocols. We also opportunistically include lemmas for desirable security properties, but do not prove them in all cases; the verification state of each such lemma is described alongside its declaration, and the verification targets in the `Makefile` that are run during continuous verification (currently) verify only those lemmas that have proof scripts or that we know Tamarin can automatically verify in a reasonable amount of time.

Currently, these models are in an _initial_ state; the individual subprotocols are complete, but their compositions are still a work in progress, and we may revise the individual subprotocols after further review.
