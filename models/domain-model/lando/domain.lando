    component Contest
     A single decision or set of associated decisions being put before the voters (for example, the option of candidates to fill a particular public office or the approval or disapproval of a constitutional amendment). This term encompasses other terms such as "race," "question," and "issue" that are sometimes used to refer to specific kinds of contests. It does not refer to the legal challenge of an election outcome.


      What are your contest choices?
      Do you allow a write-in choice?
      What is the maximum number of your contest choices that can be chosen on the same ballot?
      What is your result?
      Does the vote contain valid choices for you?

      Your contest choices are the choices!
      You do/do not allow a write-in choice!
      Your result is the result!
      The maximum number of your contest choices can be chosen on the same ballot!

      A contest must have at least one contest choice.
      The result must contain information about every contest choice in the contest.
      The contest choices for a contest may only be set once.
      The write-in allowed flag may only be set once.
      The result for a contest may only be set once.
      The maximum number of contest choices that can be chosen on the same ballot may only be set once.

        A feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. A stolen long-term secret alone cannot be used to generate previous session keys and a stolen session key cannot be used to generate previous or subsequent session keys.

          A symmetric structure used in the design of many block ciphers, that ensures both encryption and decryption use very similar operations. In a Feistel Network, the input block is divided into two halves, and in each round, one half is modified based on the output of a function applied to the other half and a subkey. The two halves are then swapped before moving to the next round. Decryption simply reverses the process by applying the same function in the reverse order of subkeys.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Key Schedule
          An algorithm that expands a relatively short encryption key into multiple subkeys used in successive rounds of encryption or decryption within a block cipher. It is critical in determining the strength of the encryption because it helps avoid repeated patterns in the ciphertext.

          A cryptographic structure used in block cipher design, similar to the Feistel Network, but with distinct properties. Like the Feistel Network, it divides the input data into two equal parts for processing. However, instead of applying the round function directly to one half, the Lai-Massey scheme applies the round function to the difference between the two halves. The result of the round function is then combined with both halves of the input block, rather than just one.

        component Product Cipher
          A type of cryptographic cipher that combines two or more transformations in a manner intending that the resulting cipher is more secure than the individual components to make it resistant to cryptanalysis. The product cipher combines a sequence of simple transformations such as substitution (S-box), permutation (P-box), and modular arithmetic.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Substitution Box (S-box)
          A fundamental component in symmetric key cryptography used to perform substitution during encryption. Its primary role is to introduce non-linearity. The S-box takes a fixed number of input bits and transforms them into output bits in a way that obscures the relationship between the ciphertext and the encryption key.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Permutation Box (P-box)
          A fundamental component in symmetric key cryptography used to achieve diffusion. The P-box takes bits from the input and rearranges them in a deterministic manner, scattering their positions. This spreading of bits ensures that changes in one part of the input will affect many parts of the output.

        component Key Size
          The length of a key used by an encryption algorithm, measured in bits. The key size determines the upper limit of security against brute force attacks, where an attacker tries every possible key combination. The larger the key size, the more potential combinations, making it harder to break the encryption by brute force.

        component Key Whitening
          A cryptographic technique used to enhance the security of block ciphers by combining the input data with portions of the key, usually through XOR operations, before the encryption process begins and after it ends.

        component Brute Force
          Cryptographic algorithm designs acknowledge the possibility of an attacker guessing certain values correctly and defeating the stated security claims. The algorithms are designed to make the probability of a correct guess negligible. This attack consists of an attacker simply guessing and checking a vast number of potential values until a correct value is found.

          An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. In a successful attack, the reading or altering of the communications allows the attacker to break stated security properties of the protocol. As it aims to circumvent mutual authentication, a MITM attack can succeed only when the attacker impersonates each party sufficiently well to satisfy the expectations of the other party.

        component Rainbow Attack
          An attack where the attacker precomputes and caches the output of a cryptographic hash function in a specific structure called a rainbow table. The rainbow table stores only the starting and ending values of a chain of hash values. Searching a rainbow table requires generating a hash chain for the queried value and checking the table for that hash chain. This is a space and time efficient method to search for and possibly retrieve an input that also results in the queried hash value. The attack is frequently used to find a password that results in a given password hash. Rainbow attacks can be mitigated by adding a salt to the hash function.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Length Extension Attack
          A type of attack where an attacker can use Hash(message1) and the length of message1 to calculate Hash(message1 ‖ message2) for an attacker-controlled message2, without needing to know the content of message1. Concatenation is denoted here as ‖. Hash functions that work by taking the input message and using it to transform an internal state and then output the entire internal state are vulnerable to this attack. The attacker reconstructs the entire internal state using the message1 hash value and uses it to process additional data creating the new output value.

          A general form of cryptanalysis based on the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. The basic method uses pairs of plaintexts related by a constant difference. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. For any particular cipher, the input difference must be carefully selected for the attack to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm's internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a differential characteristic.

        component Integral Cryptanalysis
          A general form of cryptanalysis using sets or  multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant, and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. The usage of the sums of larger sets of texts contrasts the usage of the differences of pairs of texts in differential cryptanalysis.

        component Boomerang Attack
          A method for the cryptanalysis of block ciphers based on a chosen plaintext attack using differential cryptanalysis. The attack attempts to generate a so-called "quartet" structure at a point halfway through the cipher. The attack algorithm creates chosen plaintext pairs with known differentials that cover only part of the cipher and through the decryption oracle is capable of propagating the differential through the entire cipher. The attack is applicable to hash functions built using block ciphers such as those using the Merkle-Damgård construction.

        component Slide Attack
          A form of cryptanalysis analyzing a cipher's key schedule making the number of rounds irrelevant. The attack works by breaking the cipher up into identical permutation functions, F. Function F may consist of more than one round of the cipher; it is defined by the key schedule. Many plaintext/ciphertext pairs are collected denoted as (P,C) are then used to find a slid pair which is denoted (P0,C0)(P1,C1). A slid pair has the property that P0 = F(P1) and C0 = F(C1). P1/P0 and C1/C0 are then known plaintext/ciphertext pairs for F and can be combined with a known-plaintext attack on F to extract the key used by F.

        component Rotational Cryptanalysis
          A generic cryptanalytic attack against algorithms that rely on the modular addition, bit rotation, and XOR operations (ARX for short). The basic idea of rotational cryptanalysis is that both the bit rotation and XOR operations preserve correlations between bit-rotated pairs of inputs, and that addition of bit-rotated inputs also partially preserves bit rotation correlations. Rotational pairs of inputs can thus be used to break the cipher in a way that is similar to differential cryptanalysis.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Timing Attack
          A side-channel attack where the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input. Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using cryptanalysis of known plaintext/ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to increase the rate of information leakage.

        component Extended Sparse Linearization Attack (XSL)
          A method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers. The attack involves expressing the cipher's operations as a system of overdefined quadratic equations. By applying the XSL algorithm, which leverages the sparsity and specific structure of these equations, an attacker attempts to solve for the secret key. Notably, the XSL attack requires only a limited number of known plaintexts, distinguishing it from cryptanalytic techniques that necessitate large datasets.

        component Interpolation Attack
          A type of cryptanalytic attack against block ciphers. The attack expresses the ciphertext as a polynomial of the plaintext. If the polynomial has a relatively low number of unknown coefficients, then with a collection of plaintext/ciphertext pairs, the polynomial can be reconstructed. With the polynomial reconstructed the attacker then has a representation of the encryption, without exact knowledge of the secret key. The polynomial can also be used to recover the secret key.

        component Partitioning Cryptanalysis
          A form of cryptanalysis for block ciphers that is a generalization of linear cryptanalysis. The bit sums (affine transformations) of linear cryptanalysis are replaced with more general balanced Boolean functions. Partitioning cryptanalysis works by dividing the sets of possible plaintexts and ciphertexts into efficiently computable partitions such that the distribution of ciphertexts is significantly non-uniform when the plaintexts are chosen uniformly from a given block of the partition. By analyzing how different inputs map to these partitions, an attacker can identify patterns or weaknesses that facilitate key recovery.

          A dedicated statistical cryptanalysis method for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES). Davies is a known-plaintext attack based on the non-uniform distribution of the outputs of pairs of adjacent S-boxes. The attack works by collecting many known plaintext/ciphertext pairs and calculating the empirical distribution of certain characteristics. Bits of the key can be deduced given sufficiently many known plaintexts, leaving the remaining bits to be found through brute force.

        component Rebound Attack
          A type of statistical attack on hash functions, using techniques such as rotational and differential cryptanalysis to find collisions and other interesting properties. The attack occurs in two phases: the inbound phase and the outbound phase. The inbound phase employs a meet-in-the-middle strategy to efficiently navigate through the most complex parts of a differential path. By leveraging available degrees of freedom, the attacker can deterministically satisfy certain conditions within the cipher's internal state. The outbound phase  probabilistically extends the differential path to the cipher's input and output, aiming to link the internal state conditions to actual plaintext and ciphertext pairs.

          A cryptanalysis method exploiting specific keys that cause a cipher to exhibit predictable or undesirable behavior, compromising its security. These weak keys often constitute a small fraction of the total key space, but their use can lead to vulnerabilities. To mitigate the risks associated with weak keys, cryptographic systems often include mechanisms to detect and avoid them during key generation.

        // Source: Wikipedia
        component Distinguishing Attack
          Any form of cryptanalysis on data encrypted by a cipher that allows an attacker to distinguish the encrypted data from random data. To prove that a cryptographic function is safe, it is often compared to a random oracle. If a function is a random oracle, then an attacker is unable to predict any of the output of the function. If a function is distinguishable from a random oracle, it has non-random properties. That is, there exists a relation between different outputs, or between input and output, which can be used by an attacker for example to find (a part of) the input.

        A mathematical scheme that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.

The sender uses their private key to generate a unique signature for the message that the recipient can verify using the sender's public key. This process provides non-repudiation, meaning the sender cannot deny having sent the message, and ensures that any tampering with the message after signing will invalidate the signature.

The inner function is a variation of the AES block cipher design. The iterative processing of previous state with new message blocks by the compression function continues until all message blocks are processed. As only a portion of the state is used as output, the hash function is resistant to length extension attacks.

The internal state is partitioned into a block size called the rate and the remaining portion of the state is called the capacity. As the algorithm processes the input message in a phase called absorption, the input block is XORd into the state, only effecting a block size number of bits, after which the entire state is processed by the permutation function. The output is created in a process called squeezing where a block size number of bits is read out. If this is less than the output size, the permutation function processes the state and another block size number of bits is read out. Having hidden internal state, the capacity, provides protection against length extension attacks. Keccak was chosen to be SHA-3.

              component Skein
                A family of cryptographic hash functions with a 224, 256, 384 or 512 bit output size, a 256, 512, or 1024 bit block size, and an internal state size twice that of the block size. Skein utilizes a wide pipe construction. The compression function is based off of the Threefish block cipher in Unique Block Iteration (UBI) mode. The use of UBI mode allows for the compression function to be given an additional input of which block it is processing tweaking the cipher slightly for that block. This makes traditional attacks more difficult the same message block processed more than once will yield different outputs. The wide pipe construction provides the protection against length extension attacks.

    subsystem Message Authentication
      Concepts related to the cryptographic process that ensures the integrity and authenticity of a message, confirming that it has not been altered and originates from a legitimate source.

      // Source: Wikipedia
      component Deniable Authentication
         Message authentication between a set of participants where the participants themselves can be confident in the authenticity of the messages, but it cannot be proved to a third party after the event. In practice, a message is sent with a message authentication code (MAC) and the next message sent reveals the original message's MAC key. This allows anyone to forge an alternate MAC after the receiving party is certain of the original message's authenticity.

      // Source: Wikipedia
      component Message Authentication Code (MAC)
        A cryptographic construct that verifies the integrity and authenticity of a message. It is generated by applying a secret key to the message data through a MAC algorithm, producing a fixed-size output known as the MAC tag. This tag is transmitted alongside the message. Upon receipt, the recipient, who possesses the same secret key, recalculates the MAC tag from the received message and compares it to the transmitted tag. A match confirms that the message has not been altered and originates from a legitimate source.

      // Source: Wikipedia
      component Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
        A specific type of message authentication code involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. HMAC uses a shared secret instead of digital signatures with asymmetric cryptography. HMAC can use any cryptographic hash function; the size of the output and strength of the security guarantees is that of the underlying hash function.

      // Source: CBC MACs for Arbitrary-Length Messages: The Three-Key Constructions
      component Encrypted Message Authentication Code (EMAC)
        A specific type of message authentication code that enhances the security of the Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) by addressing its limitations with variable-length messages. In EMAC, after computing the CBC-MAC of a message using a block cipher and a secret key, the resulting MAC is further encrypted with a second, independent key. This additional encryption step ensures that the MAC is secure even when messages of different lengths are processed, providing robustness against certain types of cryptographic attacks.

      // Source: NESSIE Submission Two-Track-MAC
      component Two-Track Message Authentication Code (TTMAC)
        A specific type of message authentication code that operates by processing the input message through two parallel tracks of unkeyed hash functions. The two tracks double the size of the internal state of the MAC and the combination of the tracks makes the function uninvertable. A successful attack would have to break both tracks.

      // Source: Wikipedia
      component Universal Hashing Message Authentication Code (UMAC)
        A specific type of message authentication code using universal hashing, that involves choosing a hash function from the class of universal hash functions according to some secret (random) process and applying it to the message. The resulting digest or fingerprint is then encrypted to hide the identity of the hash function that was used.

    subsystem Zero-Knowledge Proofs
      Concepts related to zero-knowledge proofs and proof systems.

      // Source: ElectionGuard
      component Zero-Knowledge Proof
        A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.
